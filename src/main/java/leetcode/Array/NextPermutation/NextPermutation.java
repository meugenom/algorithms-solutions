/***
 * 31 medium
 * 
 * A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
 * For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are considered permutations 
 * of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [2,3,1].
 * The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation 
 * of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container 
 * according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation 
 * that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, 
 * the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
 * 
 * 
 * For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
 * Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
 * While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] 
 * because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
 * Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
 * The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3]
 * Output: [1,3,2]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [3,2,1]
 * Output: [1,2,3]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,5]
 * Output: [1,5,1]
 * 
 * T.C.: O(n^2);
 * S.C.: O(1).
