package leetcode.StudentAttendanceRecordI;

/***
 * You are given a string s representing an attendance record for a student
 * where each character signifies whether the student was absent,
 * late, or present on that day.
 * The record only contains the following three characters:
 * 'A': Absent.
 * L': Late.
 * 'P': Present.
 * The student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the
 * following criteria:
 * 
 * The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
 * The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
 * Return true if the student is eligible for an attendance award, or false
 * otherwise.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "PPALLP"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The student has fewer than 2 absences and was never late 3 or
 * more consecutive days.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "PPALLL"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The student was late 3 consecutive days in the last 3 days, so
 * is not eligible for the award.
